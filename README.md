Algoritma is a library with collections of various algorithms to make our life easier


## List of Available Algorithms
These algorithms sorted by it's type and name. 

> Table's status's legends
> - [:heavy_check_mark: ] = Available to use
> - [:x: ] = Not available yet
> - [:keyboard: ] = Work in Progress

Meanwhile, our priority is Data Mining's algorithms below, but feel free to add other algorithms as well. :smile:
